This file describes the formation string format used in PvZ Toolkit / Tools.

1. The formation string is in standard Base64 encoding format and is compatible with Base64URL format.

(Theoretical length of the string is about 18~164 bytes.)

2. The decoded binary byte stream needs to be XORed with 0x54 (84) first.

3. The data stream is several bytes of zlib compressed data, followed by 1 byte of RS information bit.

+=====================+----+
| ... zlib stream ... | RS |
+======================+----+

(Theoretical length of compressed data is about 12~121 bytes.)

4. The RS information bit is divided into two parts, representing the position of the spike and the scene map respectively.

0000 0000
R S

R: The position of the rake. If it does not exist, it is represented by 0. If it exists, it is the number of rows, with the top row being the 1st row.

S: Scene map. The values ​​0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 represent day, night, swimming pool, foggy night, rooftop, and moonlit night, respectively.

5. The data is compressed using the highest level of zlib (Z_BEST_COMPRESSION).

After decompression, the plant data on the field is obtained, which consists of several GRID structures with a length of two bytes.

0 1
+---+---+
| GRID |
+---+---+

When the scene is a swimming pool or foggy night (S==2 || S==3), the total number of structures is 54, and the rest is 45.

All GRIDs are arranged in the order of writing from left to right and from top to bottom, corresponding to the actual map position.

6. Each GRID structure represents the content of a grid on the field. Divided into several parts.

000000 0 0 00 0 0 0 0 0
P P P B B K K C C L
I A I I I

| Bit | Length | Identifier | Meaning |
| ------ | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 10~15 | 6 | P | Main plant type |
| 9 | 1 | PI | Is the main plant an imitator? |
| 8 | 1 | PA | Is the main plant awake? |
| 6~7 | 2 | B | Is there a bottom plant or a tombstone? |
| 5 | 1 | BI | Is the bottom plant an imitator? |
| 4 | 1 | K | Is there a pumpkin shell? |
| 3 | 1 | KI | Is the pumpkin shell an imitator? |
| 2 | 1 | C | Is there a coffee bean? |
| 1 | 1 | CI | Is the coffee bean an imitator? |
| 0 | 1 | L | Is there a ladder?

P: 0 means no plants exist, and a value of 1~48 means plants with codes 0~47 exist.
PI: When P is valid, it indicates whether the plant is a mimic, 0 normal 1 mimic.
PA: When P is valid, it indicates whether the plant is awake, 0 asleep 1 awake.

B: 0 means no bottom plants exist, 1 water lily 2 flower pot. 3 means there is a tombstone.
BI: When there is a water lily or flower pot at the bottom, it is used to indicate whether it is a mimic, 0 normal 1 mimic.

K: 0 means no pumpkin shell exists, 1 means it exists.
KI: When there is a pumpkin shell, it is used to indicate whether it is a mimic, 0 normal 1 mimic.

C: 0 means no coffee beans exist, 1 means it exists.
CI: When there are coffee beans, it is used to indicate whether it is a mimic, 0 normal 1 Imitator.

L: 0 means no ladder, 1 means yes.

7. Other details.

The position of the rake is not more than 5 in the five-row field, not more than 6 in the six-row field and not located in the waterway.

Recommended order of placement/planting: rake water lily/flower pot main plant pumpkin shell coffee bean tombstone ladder.

P should not be water lily/flower pot/pumpkin shell/coffee bean and a value greater than 48.

PA is used in daytime scenes (S==0 || S==2 || S==4) to determine whether mushroom plants need to be awakened.
